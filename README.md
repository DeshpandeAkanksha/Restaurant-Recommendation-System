# Restaurant Recommendation System
Restaurant Recommender is a useful system for day to day life. People often visit new places, different
cities and they do not know suitable place to eat.
In this recommendation system, I provide list of restaurants that are similar to the given restaurant.
Along with the item based recommendations, I provide user review based recommendations. Many
people do consider recommendations before buying things, visiting places or staying in hotels.
Recommendations give fair idea about the place. Those are the feedbacks from people who have already
used the service. Considering recommendations help you choose the best suited service for yourself.

Technologies
Java
After a certain amount of efforts, when I was running out of time, I decided to implement my own
logic for recommendation system instead of using Mahout Library. I used Java for the recommendation
logic. and JSP, JQuery, CSS for the User Interface.
JSP
I decided to use JSP to dynamically generate web pages to take the input from the user and then to
display the output.
JQuery, CSS, Bootstrap
To give a nice look to the web pages, I decided to use Bootstrap templates along with CSS and JQuery.
Tomcat
I decided to use tomcat server which provided me the pure java HTTP web server environment in
which Java code can run.
